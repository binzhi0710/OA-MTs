# Unraveling the Shared Genetic Architecture of Osteoarthritis and Metabolic Traits Through Multi-Omics Insights

üìñ **Introduction**
This repository contains all the code for the study **Unraveling the Shared Genetic Architecture of Osteoarthritis and Metabolic Traits Through Multi-Omics Insights**. The project employs multi-omics approaches to explore the shared genetic mechanisms between osteoarthritis and metabolic traits, offering insights into their biological connections.

üóÇÔ∏è **Code Structure**
The code is organized into six folders, each corresponding to a specific part of the methodology workflow outlined in **Figure 1** of the paper:

1. **Part 1. Trait-pair level**: Code for analyzing the epidemiological associations of osteoarthritis and metabolic traits and identifying shared genetic signals.
2. **Part 2. GWAS level**: Code for conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to form OA-MT trait pairs and exploring shared genetic signals at the gene level.
3. **Part 3. TWAS level**: Code for performing transcriptome-wide association studies to explore gene expression associations.
4. **Part 4. Enrichment analysis**: Code for functional enrichment analysis to understand biological pathways and related tissues and cells.
5. **Part 5. PWAS level**: Code for proteome-wide association studies to investigate protein-level associations and protein subgroups.
6. **Part 6. Clinical significance**: Code for evaluating the clinical implications of identified genetic associations.
